/**
 * Building the fleet: work sessions plus the threads under them, each with a
 * state derived from facts the environment already reported.
 *
 * One implementation, two callers. The server answers `fabric.fleet.get` with
 * it, and the web client rebuilds it locally from the thread shells it already
 * streams, so the two cannot disagree about what "working" means.
 *
 * They do differ in one input, on purpose. `lastVisitedAt` — when *this user*
 * last opened a thread — is client state; the environment has no idea. A
 * server therefore passes null and its `done_unseen` means "a turn completed
 * and nothing has been recorded since", while a client passes its real value
 * and gets the stricter, truer answer. `docs/fabric/DECISIONS.md` D17.
