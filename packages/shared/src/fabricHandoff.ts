/**
 * Moving one piece of work from one account to another (§6.1).

 * refuses a resume across instances whose continuation identity differs, and
 * upstream's own documentation says a thread may switch "only between Claude
 * instances with the same config directory". That is exactly why the spec puts
 * the WorkSession above the ProviderSession (§5.4): the work continues, on a
 * **new** thread, carrying a capsule.
 *
 * This module is the part that decides and describes. What it produces is read
