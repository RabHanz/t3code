/**
 * §18's text injection: the abstraction, the preference order, and — the part
 * that matters most — telling the truth about what this machine can do.
 *
 * The specification's own words: *never pretend arbitrary global injection is
 * universally available*, and *surface capability must be reported honestly in
 * the UI*. Those two sentences are the whole design. Dictation that silently
 * does nothing is worse than dictation that refuses, because the user finds out
 * by discovering their sentence went nowhere, usually after saying something
 * they would rather not repeat.
 *
 * So the capability report is computed from facts about the host — platform,
 * display server, which integrations are connected, which permissions were
 * granted — and every unavailable method carries a reason a person can act on.
