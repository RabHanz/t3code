/**
 * Natural language to orchestration rules, by grammar.
 *
 * §13's rule, applied a phase early: **deterministic grammar and metadata
 * first.** No model decides what a sentence means here, in V1 or otherwise,
 * for a reason that is not purism — a rule that starts provider sessions and
 * spends a subscription must be something the user can read back and disagree
 * with. A parser that quietly guesses produces rules nobody audits.
 *
 * So the grammar is small and it **refuses loudly**. When a clause cannot be
 * placed, the result names the exact words it could not place, rather than
 * dropping them and building a rule that does less than the sentence said.
 * That refusal is the feature: it is what tells the user to rephrase instead
 * of discovering later that "and tell me if either needs me" was ignored.
 *
 * The sentence this must handle is the specification's own (§29 Phase 9):
 *
 *   "When Claude finishes this, have Codex review it and tell me if either
 *    needs me."
