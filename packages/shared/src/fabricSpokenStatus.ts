/**
 * Spoken status — the §20 "Jarvis" answers, as a pure function.
 *
 * The specification's rule: **answer from state and synopsis before
 * interrupting a provider session.** Nothing here asks an agent anything. It
 * turns the fleet the environment already reported into a sentence a person
 * can hear while walking away from the desk.
 *
 * Phase 5 wires a microphone to this; it is a pure function today so the
 * wording can be tested, reviewed and changed without a voice pipeline, and so
 * the same sentences can appear as text in the UI.
 *
 * Style rules, from the examples in §20:
 *   - name the account and what it is doing, not the thread id;
 *   - say whether the user is needed, because that is the question behind the
 *     question;
 *   - never invent a number or a result — every clause comes from a field.
