/**
 * One sentence to one Fabric command, by grammar.
 *
 * §13's instruction, taken literally: **do not feed every transcript blindly
 * into an LLM; use deterministic grammar and metadata first.** In V1 there is
 * no "then". Nothing here calls a model, and nothing here may: the whole point
 * of a voice surface is that the user can trust what a half-heard sentence will
 * do, and a probabilistic parser makes that impossible to promise.
 *
 * The four rules this file follows:
 *
 *   1. **Resolve to ids, never to words.** The command that comes out names a
 *      work session id, a provider instance id, a firing id. Execution never
 *      re-reads the sentence, so there is exactly one interpretation and it is
 *      the one the user was shown.
 *   2. **Refuse with the words.** Every refusal carries the phrase it could not
 *      place. "I did not understand" teaches nothing; "I could not place
 *      'the hetzner one'" tells the user what to say instead.
 *   3. **Never guess a target.** A named target that matches nothing is a
 *      refusal, not a fallback to whatever is on screen. Falling back is how a
 *      message meant for one account lands in another.
 *   4. **A sentence never authorises a high-risk action** (§24.1, §24.2).
 *      Production deploys, protected merges, destructive database work,
 *      secrets and purchases are recognised *by name* and refused as such,
 *      rather than being left to fail as gibberish.
