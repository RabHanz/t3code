/**
 * The desktop context bus, as a pure reducer, and §14's ladder over it.
 *
 * §15 asks for a local service that several producers write to and the voice
 * surface reads from. The part worth testing is not the IPC — it is the
 * arithmetic: which producer's fact wins, when a fact stops counting, and
 * which rung of §14 a given sentence lands on. That is what this module is.
 *
 * Three rules, each of which is a failure it prevents:
 *
 *   1. **One slot per producer.** VS Code going quiet must not erase what the
 *      browser just said. A single merged snapshot would let the last writer
 *      delete every other producer's facts.
 *   2. **Facts expire.** A producer that stopped reporting is not evidence of
 *      where the user is now. Routing a message into a VS Code window that was
 *      closed ten minutes ago is exactly the failure §14 exists to prevent, and
 *      an unexpiring bus makes it certain.
 *   3. **The ladder stops where the facts stop.** Each rung below is a rung
 *      some producer actually reports. Nothing here infers, and nothing here
 *      consults a model — §14's rung 8 is a semantic resolver and this module
 *      does not have one.
 *
