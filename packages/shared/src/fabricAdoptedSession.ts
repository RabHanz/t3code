 *     rather than mapped to `idle`, because a session that needs the user
 *     sorted to the bottom of the fleet is the one wrong state that does real
 *     harm.
 *   - **The capability declaration.** An adopted session is a terminal
 *     somebody else started. Fabric cannot read its conversation, answer its
 *     approvals or show its diffs, and every one of those refusals says which
 *     capability is missing and why — before the button is pressed, not after.

 *     loop, and an unclassified live terminal is exactly that.
 *   - a bare prompt → `idle`, which is simply true.
