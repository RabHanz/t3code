/**
 * Presentation logic for the Fleet view.
 *
 * The §33 shape:
 *
 * ```text
 * ● VentureOS / Scheduler     Working
 * ! Production / Deploy       Approval needed
 * ◐ Spotler / Reviewer        Reviewing
 * ✓ Margin / Search           Done
 * ```
 *
 * Glyph, then project and work, then the state — and, secondary, which account
 * and which host. Pure, so the wording and the ordering can be asserted without
 * rendering anything.
 *
 * It lives in `shared` rather than in a client because **both** clients render
 * this list, and the phone is where getting it wrong matters most: §29 Phase 7
 * wants the fleet on a screen the user glances at while walking away from the
 * desk. Two implementations of "what does this row say" would drift, and the
 * drift would be silent — the web would say a session needs you and the phone
 * would not.
