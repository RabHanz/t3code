/**
 * What Fabric keeps, and for how long (§26).
 *
 * §26's voice defaults are the principle: keep what became a command, not the
 * stream it arrived on. Fabric's own logs generalise it — every sentence it was
 * given and every rule that fired are useful for days and a liability for ever.
 *
 * The horizon is a policy rather than a habit, the selection is a pure function
 * so it can be asserted rather than trusted, and one thing is deliberately kept
 * longer than convenience would suggest: **refusals**. A log that keeps only
 * what worked cannot show a grammar its own blind spots.
