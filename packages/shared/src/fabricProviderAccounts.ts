/**
 * Adding a second provider account, as a plan somebody can read before it runs.
 *
 * The Director's requirement, in his words: _"any new profile I add picks up
 * the same config"_. A new account is a place to keep **one login** and nothing
 * else — the skills, agents, commands, plugins, memory tree and instructions
 * stay the primary's, shared.
 *
 * This module decides *where* and *what to say*; it touches no filesystem, so
 * the interesting half — which directory, which command, and whether an
 * existing profile is being reused rather than duplicated — is testable without
 * one.
 *
 * Two provider shapes, both already understood by T3:
 *
 *   - **Claude** keys off `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, and the layout is materialised by
 *     `ClaudeAccountHome.ts` (D52).
 *   - **Codex** keys off `CODEX_HOME` with a *shadow home*, which upstream
 *     already implements: `auth.json` private, everything else linked from the
 *     shared home. Fabric does not reinvent it; it names the same directory and
 *     lets the Codex driver materialise it.
 *
 * @module fabricProviderAccounts
