/**
 * The written half of the Working Synopsis (D51), with none of the model in it.
 *
 * §11 always allowed semantic summarisation at milestones; D16 declined it
 * while the fork had no model on any path. D50 put one there, and the Director
 * asked for the same thing here: two sentences that say where the work is and
 * what is needed, in place of a label assembled from event names.
 *
 * What the model is **not** allowed to decide, and this module is where that is
 * enforced:
 *
 *   - **the state.** `needsUser` — and therefore whether the fleet interrupts
 *     somebody — stays derived from events. A model guessing "needs approval"
 *     is a model deciding whether to interrupt a person, which is not a
 *     summarisation task.
 *   - **the facts.** `changedFiles`, `validation` and `recentFindings` are
 *     observations, and they keep coming from the events that observed them. A
 *     model that "remembers" a file nobody touched is worse than no synopsis.
 *
 * It writes `currentAction` and `next`, and it marks the synopsis `source:
 * "model"` so a reader always knows which kind they are looking at.
 *
 * @module fabricSynopsisModel
