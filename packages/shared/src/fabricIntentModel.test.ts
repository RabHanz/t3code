/**
 * The rails, proven without a model.
 *
 * Every one of these is a way a model can be wrong, and the point of D50's
 * design is that being wrong in these ways is not dangerous: an invented id, a
 * paraphrase of a refused request, a confident guess between two work sessions,
 * an empty message. A test per failure mode, run in milliseconds and costing
 * nothing, is what makes the ten real sentences a proof rather than a demo.
