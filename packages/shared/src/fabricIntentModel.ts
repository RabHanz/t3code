/**
 * The model's half of the intent path, with none of the model in it.
 *
 * D50 reversed D24: a sentence the grammar cannot place is now read by a model
 * rather than refused. What did **not** change is the thing that made the
 * grammar-only design safe, and this module is where that is enforced:
 *
 *   1. **The model answers in a schema, not in prose.** It picks a command kind
 *      from a closed list and names its target by an id it was shown. It cannot
 *      invent a work session, a project, an account or a parked question.
 *   2. **Every id it returns is checked against the same vocabulary the grammar
 *      uses.** An id that is not in that list is a refusal that names what the
 *      model said, not a best-effort match.
 *   3. **§24.1 is matched deterministically before and after.** Before, by the
 *      grammar, which refuses a high-risk sentence and never reaches here.
 *      After, by `highRiskSubject` applied to the effectful free text the model
 *      produced — because a model asked to be helpful is exactly the component
 *      that would turn a vague sentence into "deploy to production" inside the
 *      message an agent then receives.
 *   4. **Low confidence is a question, never a guess.** Two plausible readings
 *      produce a refusal carrying the model's own question, which the input
 *      shows before Enter does anything.
 *
 * Nothing here calls a model, spawns a process or reads a clock: this is the
 * prompt, the reply schema, and the function that turns a reply into a
 * resolution or a refusal. That is what makes every rule above testable without
 * spending a turn.
 *
