 * §11's rule, and the reason this is a struct of small typed fields rather
 * than a paragraph: **update deterministically from events whenever possible.**
 * A file changed, a test started, an approval was requested, a turn settled —
 * each of those is a fact the environment already reported, and turning it into
 * a synopsis field costs nothing and cannot hallucinate. Asking the agent to
 * summarise itself on a cadence costs tokens and invents.
 *
 * §11's other rule is here too: **the synopsis must never silently become
 * authoritative over Git or provider reality.** Hence `updatedAt` on every
 * field group and `staleAfterSeconds` on the record: a surface that shows a
 * synopsis shows how old it is, and a consumer that needs the truth reads Git
 * or the thread.
