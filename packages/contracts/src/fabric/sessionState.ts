/**
 * Provider-neutral session state, and the deterministic rules that produce it.
 *
 * The specification's §10 is emphatic on one point and this module exists to
 * hold it: **never use a model to infer a state T3 already expresses.** Every
 * value below is computed from structured data the environment already sends —
 * pending approvals, pending questions, session status, background liveness,
 * the latest turn, the provider's own quota report, and whether the
 * environment is reachable at all. There is no transcript reading here and
 * there must not be.
 *
 * Source priority, §10, highest first:
 *
 *   1. provider-native / T3 structured events  (`session`, `hasPending*`)
 *   2. T3 orchestration state                  (`latestTurn`, `backgroundLiveness`)
 *   3. explicit provider usage-limit responses (`usageLimits`)
 *   4. Herdr semantic integration              (Phase 8, absent here)
 *   5. process / terminal heuristics           (not used)
 *   6. transcript inference                    (never)
 *
 * Reachability outranks all of it: a state read off a stale cache from an
 * environment that is gone would be a lie with a confident face.
