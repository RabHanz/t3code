/**
 * Intent: one sentence in, one Fabric command out.
 *
 * §13's model, built where it can actually be relied on. The Director's north
 * star is that he speaks into whatever microphone is nearest — iOS dictation,
 * Wispr Flow, a DJI receiver through his own speech-to-text — and the fleet
 * does the thing. **The fork owns everything after the text exists.** No
 * microphone, no wake word, no speech model lives here; a phone's dictation
 * and a keyboard produce the same string, and this is what that string means.
 *
 * Three properties hold, and they are the whole reason this is a contract
 * rather than a prompt:
 *
 *   1. **Deterministic first, and deterministic last** (§13: "do not feed every
 *      transcript blindly into an LLM"). A grammar decides what a sentence
 *      means whenever it can, instantly and identically every time. A sentence
 *      the grammar cannot place is read by a model (D50), which must answer in
 *      *this* schema — naming ids that exist — and whose answer is checked by
 *      the same deterministic rules on the way out. The user is still told
 *      exactly what will happen before it happens; that read-back is now the
 *      thing that makes a model on this path safe rather than a shortcut.
 *   2. **A refusal names the words it could not place.** Guessing is the one
 *      behaviour that makes a voice surface untrustworthy: a misheard sentence
 *      that starts a provider session is worse than one that does nothing.
 *   3. **A sentence never authorises a high-risk action** (§24.2). The
 *      classifier recognises §24.1's HIGH list explicitly and refuses it by
 *      name, rather than failing to parse it and saying something vague.
