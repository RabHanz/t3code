/**
 * One Claude account's config directory: its credentials, everybody's

 *
 * The Director's requirement, in his words: _"any new profile I add picks up
 * the same config"_. A second Claude login should not mean a second copy of the
 * skills, the agents, the commands, the plugins, the memory tree or
 * `CLAUDE.md` — those are his, not the account's. Only the credentials and the
 * per-account state belong to the account.
 *
 * **This is upstream's own mechanism, applied to the other provider.**
 * `CodexHomeLayout.ts` already does exactly this for Codex — `auth.json` stays
 * private, every other entry in the shared home is symlinked into the shadow
 * home, and the layout is re-materialised on every session start. Claude had no
 * equivalent: `ClaudeHome.ts` sets `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and nothing else, so a
 * second account got an empty directory and none of the user's configuration.
 *
 * Re-materialising on every start is also the answer to the question the
 * Director raised and the one that actually decides whether this works: *do
 * symlinks survive the CLI's writes?* Rather than assume, the layout is
 * re-established before each session, a private entry that has become a symlink
 * is a named error, and a shared entry that has become a real file is a named
 * error too — the two ways this silently forks are both refusals instead.
