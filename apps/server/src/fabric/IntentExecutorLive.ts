/**
 * Everything a sentence is allowed to cause.
 *
 * Seven commands, and nothing else can be added by phrasing — a new capability
 * needs a new member of the union in `fabric/intent.ts`, a grammar rule that
 * produces it, and a case here. That is three files somebody reviews, which is
 * the point: the surface where a half-heard sentence turns into action is
 * exactly where a short, named list of effects earns its keep (§22's argument,
 * applied to §13's model).
 *
 * Nothing here re-reads the user's words. It is handed ids, and it acts on
 * them, so what runs is what the user was shown.
 *
 * Threads are created and messaged through `OrchestrationEffectsService` — the
 * same narrow surface a rule uses — rather than through a second path into the
 * engine. One place creates threads, whatever asked for them.
