/**
 * Evaluates orchestration rules, on the same events Phase 4's state derivation
 * reads.
 *
 * The reactor's only judgement is arithmetic: it computes the work session's
 * `FabricSessionState` with the shared derivation, asks `shouldFire` whether a
 * rule may run, and runs it. **No model decides that anything finished.** That
 * matters more here than anywhere else in Fabric, because a wrong "it's done"
 * starts a provider session and spends a subscription.
 *
 * Two ordering choices worth naming:
 *
 *   - **The state is recomputed, not taken from the event.** A single thread
 *     event does not tell you what the *work* is doing when two threads are
 *     live, and a rule that fired on one thread finishing while its sibling
 *     was still failing would be firing on the wrong fact.
 *   - **A firing is recorded before its action runs.** If the action crashes,
 *     the bound has still been spent. The alternative — record on success —
 *     lets a rule whose action reliably fails retry forever, which is the loop
 *     wearing a different hat.
