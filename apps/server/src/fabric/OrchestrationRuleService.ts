/**
 * Bounded orchestration: deciding whether a rule may fire, recording that it
 * did, and refusing when it must not.
 *
 * The decision is deliberately kept out of the reactor and out of the action
 * executor, in `shouldFire` below, because it is the part where §22's "no
 * hidden infinite loops" is either enforced or lost, and it is the part worth
 * asserting on its own. Three refusals, each for a different failure:
 *
 *   - **the bound** — `firedCount` has reached `maxFirings`, so the rule is
 *     exhausted and says so rather than going quiet;
 *   - **self-triggering** — the state change came from a thread this rule's own
 *     firing created, which is the loop §22 names;
 *   - **sequencing** — an `after_rule` trigger whose predecessor has not
 *     completed.
 *
 * Nothing here consults a model. The trigger matches a `FabricSessionState`
 * the environment derived from its own events (§10), so "finished" means what
 * the fleet already says it means.
