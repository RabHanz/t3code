/**
 * What this desktop can honestly type into — §18, answered from the machine
 * rather than from hope.
 *
 * The specification is blunt about Linux: *Wayland may restrict global
 * injection. Prefer application-specific integrations and supported
 * desktop/accessibility/portal mechanisms; never pretend arbitrary global
 * injection is universally available.* This module is where that promise is
 * kept or broken, so it reads the session's own facts — platform, display
 * server, granted permissions, connected integrations — and hands the shared
 * report builder something true.
 *
 * Deliberately a pure function of an environment snapshot, not a reader of
 * `process` at call time: the interesting cases are other people's machines,
 * and the only way to test them here is to be handed their facts.
