/**
 * Fabric's desktop-side answers.

 * display server, the OS accessibility grant and the platform all live in the
 * main process — and guessing produces dictation that silently goes nowhere.
 *
 * The renderer supplies the half it knows: whether an application integration
 * (its own focused field, a connected VS Code or browser extension) is
 * available right now. The main process supplies the half the OS knows. Neither
 * half is invented.
