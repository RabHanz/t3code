 *
 *   - **Rung 3 has a producer.** "What is open in Fabric" was a fact nobody
 *     reported until now, so `focusedWorkSessionId` was always null and "tell
 *     it to stop" always fell through to whatever moved last. The client knows
 *     which thread is on screen; this turns that into the work session it
 *     belongs to.
 *   - **Dictation refuses by name.** A browser tab cannot type into Gmail in
 *     another window, and saying nothing while the words go nowhere is the
 *     failure §18 is written against.
