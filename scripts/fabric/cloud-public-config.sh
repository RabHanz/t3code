# Print the three public T3 Connect config values that a fork build does not
# carry, read out of an installed official release.
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# `hasCloudPublicConfig` (apps/server/src/cloud/publicConfig.ts) is the gate on
# the whole T3 Connect startup path: with it false, the server never reconciles
# the desired cloud link, so no managed tunnel is provisioned and the
# environment is unreachable from t3.codes. It is true only when a relay URL, a
# Clerk publishable key and a Clerk CLI OAuth client id are present — and in the
# official release those arrive as build-time defines injected by upstream's CI
# (`__T3CODE_BUILD_*__`), which a fork build has no way to reproduce.
#
# All three are *public* identifiers: they ship in plain text inside every
# published `t3` binary, the Clerk key is a publishable key by Clerk's own
# naming, and the relay URL is a public hostname. They are still not committed
# to this repository, for two reasons: they are upstream's cloud, not ours, and
# a fork that may be open-sourced should not carry another project's
# environment as source. So they are read at deploy time from whichever release
# is installed on the machine, and handed to the fork's unit as environment.
#
# Deliberately NOT printed: the relay client's OTLP tracing triple, which
# includes an Axiom *ingest* token. That one is a credential, it is upstream's,
# and a fork has no business writing into their telemetry dataset. Leaving it
# unset disables relay-client tracing, which is the correct default for a fork.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/fabric/cloud-public-config.sh [/path/to/official/t3] [--systemd]
#
# With no path, the newest non-fabric version under $T3CODE_HOME/runtime/versions
# is used. `--systemd` prints `Environment=` lines for a unit drop-in instead of
# bare KEY=value pairs.
